        <h1>CLS 63 AMG</h1>
        <p><b><i> The Mercedes-Benz CLS63 AMG four-door coupe line gets a performance upgrade and introduces an entirely new model to its 2014 lineup with the CLS63 AMG S-Model. The S-Model boasts performance-oriented AMG 4MATIC all-wheel drive and an AMG 5.5-liter V8 biturbo engine that now makes 577 horsepower and 590 lb.-ft. of torque. The AMG 5.5-liter V8 biturbo engine (known internally as the M157) continues to be a pinnacle of efficiency: an unusual combination of high performance and high fuel mileage that remains unrivaled worldwide in its market segment.
        Mercedes-Benz AMG is also launching a number of high-performance sedans and coupes with an AMG-engineered version of the all-wheel-drive system known as 4MATIC. Geared to sporty driving, this system offers drivers a level of performance never before seen in the segment. Alongside the successful SUVs - ML63 AMG, GL63 AMG and G63 AMG - five unique models in the CLA, E-Class and CLS-Class lines are now available with a standard high-performance AMG 4MATIC system.
        "The S-Models in particular represent the most attractive proposition in the segment," notes Ola Källenius, CEO of Mercedes-AMG GmbH. "With its superlative power and torque ratings and the new performance-oriented AMG 4MATIC all-wheel drive, the CLS 63 AMG is without parallel in its Coupe and Shooting Brake (not available in the USA) variants. Our AMG 5.5-liter V8 engine remains the most efficient series production V8 engine in the world. The new, customized model variants provide greater scope than ever for individual solutions.</i></b></p>

        <h4><b><u>The Mercedes-Benz CLS (initially called the CLS-Class) is a series of executive cars produced by Mercedes-Benz from December 2003 to August 2023.
        The original model was a four-door sedan based on the Mercedes E-Class platform, marketed as a four door coupé.[1] An estate (shooting brake) model was later added to the model range with the second generation CLS.[2] All models are available as a high performance AMG variant, although it wasn't until the second generation CLS that 4MATIC all-wheel drive was offered.[3]
        The CLS range is positioned between the E-Class and the S-Class within the Mercedes model range,[4][5] and models tend to be less practical than the E-Class it is based on.[6] It primarily competes with other fastback sedans like the BMW 8 Series Gran Coupe, Porsche Panamera and Audi A7. Production of the CLS ended on 31 August 2023 to prepare for the launch of the new Mercedes-Benz E-Class (W214).
