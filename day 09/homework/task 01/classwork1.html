        <h1>BMW M5 E60</h1>
        <p><b><i>The BMW M5 E60 is the fourth generation of the M5 and was in many ways a departure. The concept of the sportscar as sedan, combining performance with luxury, was firmly established in 2005. The competition was fierce. The new BMW M5 thus had to be an emotional technology provider like almost no other car, a performance show, a statement of driving pleasure, whilst remaining maximally suitable for everyday use.
        Progress demanded some unusual solutions in the new model: the digitalisation of many components, the obvious sportiness and above all the drive train concept. It was clear from the start that the new M5 had to surpass the performance of its predecessor. The target size for the new M5 in the USA was at least 500 bhp (SAE). In the end, the new M5 achieved 507 hp in Germany, thus ensuring the prestigious 5 was also the first number of its maximum performance figure in the USA.</i></b></p>

        <h4> <b> <u> The BMW M5 is a super high-performance variant of the BMW 5 Series marketed under the BMW M sub-brand. It is considered an iconic vehicle in the sports saloon category.[1][2] The M5 has always been produced in the saloon (sedan, US English) body style, but in some countries the M5 has also been available as an estate/touring (wagon, US English) from 1992 to 1995, from 2006 to 2010, and since 2024.[3][4][5]
        The first M5 model was hand-built beginning in late 1984 on the E28 535i chassis with a modified engine from the M1 that made it the fastest production saloon at the time.[6] M5 models have been produced for every generation of the 5 Series since 1984, with occasional gaps in production (1995 to 1998, 2023 to 2024).</u> </b> <h4>
